\title{Curve segment starting; let circle be indxed by 0,1, where 0 is the beginning of the circle (center right) moving clockwise to 1 back to center right
run is the length of the curve, so run = 1 is a full circle, run = .5 is a semi circle etc; run -x, goes anticlockwise
Then semi circle might start at .5 and end at 1, or start even at .75 and end at 2.}
\usage{
gt_curve(cx = 0, cy = 0, radx = 1, rady = 1, col = "red",
  fine = 100, type = "l", from = 0, run = 1, new = FALSE, main = "",
  lwd = 1, arrow = FALSE, arlength = (radx + rady)/4, tilt = 0,

\arguments{
\item{cx}{a number x center of curve}
