\usage{
gt_tree(H, U, P, textsize = 1.5, utextsize = textsize,
  btextsize = textsize, solution = TRUE, mark.branches = ((ncol(H) -
  1):1), offset = 0.18, player.names = c(1:ncol(U)), thickline = 3,
  uspacing = 0.5, title = "", slopetext = TRUE, branchcol = "blue",
  sadj = ncol(H)/(nrow(H) + 1), uss = TRUE, angled = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{textsize}{Text size}

\item{utextsize}{is textsize for utilities}

\item{solution}{FALSE to turn off computation of SPNE}

\item{offset}{Used to adjust  text offsetting}

\item{player.names, }{a matrix of player labels in the order specified in U}

\item{sadj}{does a fix on the text slope}

\item{uss}{indicates to write utilitys in form u_name; otherwise just name}

\item{H:}{A matrix of histories with one row per terminal node, and one column per time period, entries are node labels. First column is normally all 0s for the origin; if first column has variation an origin is added to the hostory.}

\item{U:}{A matrix of utilities with one row per terminal node, and one column per player}

\item{P:}{A matrix of players identifiers (numbered according to columns in U), row per terminal node, and one column per time period (less one)}

\item{thickness}{of line for SPNE}
}
\description{
Thus function is in development. It draws game trees and identifies subgame perfect equilibria when this is unique
Backwards induction is implemented under the assumption that utilities are "generic" and so a unique solution exits.
}
\details{
In this version the graphing is not good when there are multiple solutions or indifference at given nodes.

\examples{
# A chicken game:
  H <- matrix(c("C", "C", "D", "D", "C", "D",  "C", "D"),4)
  U <- matrix(c(1,0,2,-1,1,2, 0, -1), 4)
  P <- matrix(c(rep(1,4), rep(2,4)),4)
  gt_tree(H,U,P, title = "Sequential Chicken")
# A game in which options depend on past history.
  H <- matrix(c("Take hostages", "Take hostages", "             Don't take hostages", "Pay Ransom", "Don't pay", ""),3)
  U <- matrix(c(1,-1,0,-1,-2,0), 3)
  P <-  matrix(c(rep(1,3), rep(2,3)),3)
  gt_tree(H,U,P,solution=FALSE, player.names=c("Militants", "Gov"))
Same game with a solution, though note the phantom highlighting in this example.
  gt_tree(H,U,P,solution=TRUE, player.names=c("Militants", "Gov"))
