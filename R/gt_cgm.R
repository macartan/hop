#' Clarke-Groves Mechanism.
#'
#' Utility for public good is of the form u(x | theta_i) = theta_i*x^.5 - t_i. Default cost equals amount produced, say.  Consider two games. In one each is charged x/2. In the other VCG transfers are used.  Games solved as normal form games (as if in fact players know the other's preferences, even if mechanism does not)
